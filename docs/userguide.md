## interface

The pano web app is made of 3 main pages. Starting the app for the first time will leave the user on the *[index page]*.
this page lists all the panos currently in the systems with base tools for managing them. this page can be found by clicking *[index page]* in the nav bar.

the next item *[upload page]* allows the user to upload equrectangule images to build up a pano, once the process has completed this new pano will be accessable from the *[index page]*.

The final page, *[pano page]* wont be apprent until the user has successfully uploaded a pano and clicked on it from the *[index page]*.

## Prerequiresites

Before you can actually create a pano using *[pano]* you'll need some images. The minimal images required to create a pano is a single equirectangular image. there is an exmaple image [here](http://google.com).

Information on creating advanced panos can be found [here](http://google.com).
